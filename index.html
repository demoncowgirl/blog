  <p class = "story">I have a BA in Humanities & Music and an MLA in Liberal Arts & Publishing, and now, an AAS in Computer Programming.
    I moved to Lexington, from Minnesota, last August and I love it here! I acquired my AAS through a dislocated workers
    program, after I lost my job of ten years. During that ten years, I worked as a Senior Customer Support Representative,
    at a call center. I intereacted regularly with the website developers, when there were issues with the site, and as they
    updated the website. This experience has me really interested particulary interested in User Interface and User Experience
    Interface, but as long as I am coding, I'll be happy! I would like to work more with mobile applications, too.<br><br>

    My fiance, Mike, our two dogs, Ellie Mae and Roni,
    our two cats, Piccolo and Micky, and I are currently living with his
    mother and can't wait to have a place of our own again. Mike works for the Local 181, International Union of
    Operators and Engineers as a heavy equipment operator.<br><br>

    My youngest son, Aaron, is in this photo with me. It was taken when he was 17, during
    his Senior photos. He just turned 22 and will be graduating from North Dakota State
    University (Fargo, ND), with a degree in Finance, next May.<br><br>

    My oldest son, Ian, is 26 and has been in the USAF for almost six years. He has been deployed
    four times, and this mom hopes he doesn't sign up for four more! He lives in Florida with his dog, Pip.<br><br>

    My parents, and one of my two sisters, still live in Minnesota. My yougest sister lives in Denver.<br>
