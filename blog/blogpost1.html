<p>As a recent graduate, of a two-year technical school Computer Programming program, I was concerned that my my courses had not provided me with a fully rounded education. As an on-line student, even through a reputable tech school and community college with multiple campuses in Minnesota, I missed the face-to-face interaction with instructors and other students. I have realized that it is very important to be able to work collaboratively and to have the input of other programmers. There is nothing more frustrating than debugging a program without the benefit of another programmer who may see things more clearly. With each of us having different levels of education and varying thought processes, I had also missed out on learning multiple ways of writing code that working side-by-side with others provides. The ability to ask questions, of the instructors, and to receive a timely answers and explanations, has been indispensable. This interaction and sharing of knowledge is so important and something I really missed before attending bootcamp.</p>
	<p>After my first two weeks of bootcamp, I realize that I have been correct in many of my assumptions. I have already learned many things, that were lacking in my tech school education, including tricks and shortcuts to make programming easier and more efficient. I had not been taught how to use version controls, like GitHub, nor how to create a break in code to debug more easily, nor how to use developer tools like inspecting elements in web pages to gain important information. I am sure that this is only a very small part of what I have yet to learn in bootcamp.<img src="images/brain.png" style="height: 221px; width: 300px;"></img></p>
	<p>	As I get ready to go into week 3, my brain feels like a saturated sponge, sitting in a puddle of water. The amount of information that has been provided, feels overwhelming at times, but I can see that the information I have been unable to soak up immediately is out there and will be absorbed and understood. Even with a few shaky days of self-doubt, I have also realized that my AAS in Computer Programming was not futile and has provided me with a great base for programming. Web development bootcamp is the cherry-on-top that will be incredibly beneficial as I start my job search, and eventually a career in web development. This first two weeks has also made me realize that I do understand more than I give myself credit for and I am very capable of learning immense amounts of new information in a short period of time. It has already been a boost to my confidence.</p>
	<p>With so many things that I have already learned at bootcamp the difference between “front-end” and “back-end” and “full-stack” developing, and the parts that make each up, is something I never completely understood, and was never taught in school. It is now, finally making sense to me. I will explore and explain the differences, and what I have learned, in future blog posts. I hope to also understand the fine line between “user experience” and “user interface” sometime in the next 10-weeks. I even reported back, to my Rural Minnesota Career Exploration and Planning (RMCEP) dislocated workers program advisor, that it would be beneficial for her to start considering web development bootcamps, in Minnesota, as great options for other dislocated workers. In conclusion, I can already confirm that enrolling in Awesome Inc. U’s Web Development Bootcamp was an incredibly positive move in the right direction and am very excited to learn whatever is up next.
