  <h1>Frameworks, Libraries and Things</h1>

  		<h2>Week 3<br>
  		June , 2018 </h2>

      <div class = "main p-3 m-15">
        <p> For me to be able to learn something well, to truly understand it and to really retain it, I find that if I reorganize the notes that I have taken, expand on them and create cheats sheets from them, it helps me considerably.  I typically put my reorganized notes into a folder so that I can access them easily. Right now, at the end of week 3, with the introduction of so much new information I find that many of my notes are nothing more than short phrases or individual words saved to that trigger recall of what I have learned. This week, I am going to look at the definitions, differences and examples of different frameworks, plugins, packages and libraries and how they fit together.</p>

        <h1>What is a framework?</h1>
        <p>A <strong>framework </strong>is built on top of a programming language to aid in a certain type of computer program, such as a web server or a mobile application, but a framework is not necessary for building applications and there can be more than one framework for each language. There are also frameworks for software applications and frameworks for web development.  For Ruby, the web framework is Rails. Django and Flask are web frameworks built on top of Python., and React, Angular and Vue are frameworks built on top of Javascript. Frameworks help to increase performance and to extend capabilities as well as provide libraries. Some also offer APIs and modals.</p>

        <h1>What is a library?</h1>
        <p>A <strong>library</strong> contains pieces of shared code that is usually, but not always, written in the same code as the framework. It can be reused so that certain functionality does not need to be built from scratch. I think of them as shortcuts. Libraries are also referred to as packages or modules, adding to a bit of my confusion.  They can also be a part of the coding language(standard library), or come from an external source (external library).</p>

        <p>So there is only one framework used in an application, but there can be many libraries.. Changing the programming language and framework is very hard once the coding application has been started, although it is easier to change the framework, as some pieces of code may be swapped to the new framework.</p>

        <p>Besides libraries, web application frameworks can include APIs, scaffolding, AJAX, caching, security and compilers. JavaScript frameworks include Angular, jQuery, Node.JS, ExpressJS and React JS.  Express is a back-end library—I’ve also seen it referred to as a framework which contributes to my confusion -- that runs on the node.js platform and Bootstrap is a front-end framework. Vue and Express are JavaScript libraries.   CSS frameworks include the pre-compilers LESS and Sass.</p>

        <h1>What is an API?</h1>
        <p>An API, (Application Programming Interface) like openweathermap.org,  interprets data provides developers with this information in a way that can be used. It is the middle man between you and a whole lot of data! You send  a request for information. It is then retrieved, interpreted and returned to you in a way that can be understood. Facebook is an API. An API also provides some security, as the data shared is in small packets and is only what you need.</p>

        <h1> And still more things....</h1>
        <p>Adding to my confusion, it appears that there is some dabate as to whether PHP is a language or a framework.  It is referred to as a framework, but  Laravel is one of the frameworks built on top of the PHP framework, but PHP can work on it’s own, without a framework. OK, so what is PHP? A language, or a framework?</p>

        <p>Yay! I’m starting to understand how they all fit together now, although the more I learn, the more new technologies pop-up. So frameworks, like Boostrap and Express give languages a boost and they contain libraries of reusable code, that are like shortcuts, and make things easier and faster for developers. Now, I need to learn more about modals,  scaffolding, transpiler and compilers, like Babel,  and http clients , like the promise based client AXIOS, and the runtime environment.</p>
